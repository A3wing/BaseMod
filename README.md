#A Base to Build From!

Comes with most basic requirements for a mod.

This is simply a base for people to build from and includes no content, aside from a few example recipes. 

My hope is that it is simple to understand and easy to use.

##Development Setup

1. Fork this project to your own Github repository and clone it to your desktop.
2. Navigate to the directory you cloned to. Open a command window there and run `gradlew [setupDevWorkspace|setupDecompWorkspace] [eclipse|idea]`.
3. This process will setup Forge and your workspace.
4. Open the project in your IDE of choice.
5. Set `../src/api/java` as a source directory.

I *do not* require any credit for this. I wrote it primarily for myself to use in my own mods and there's literally no reason for it to not be public.

##FAQ:

* __Oh no! I found a bug/leak with it! D:__
   
   Please feel free to make a PR with a fix or open an issue on GitHub.

* __Can you include X feature?__
   
   Possibly. I don't want to do all the work for modders, and I don't want this to become a coremod/dependency.

* __Why should I use this?__
   
   I feel it saves time for beginning modders so they don't have to rewrite everything whenever they start a new project. If you don't feel it's useful, don't use it. Simple as that.

* __Can you port to Minecraft 1.X.X?__ 
   
   Sure, why not. However, most of this will work in all versions. One large exception being the config GUI.

* __Who the heck are you?__
  
   I am the developer of:
   * Redstone Armory
   * ResourcefulCrops
   * Electro-Magic Tools
   * Test Pack Please Ignore
